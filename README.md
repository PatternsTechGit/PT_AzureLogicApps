# Fetching Azure Active Directory's users list using Azure Logic app

## What is Azure Logic Apps?

[Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview) is a cloud service platform for creating and running the workflow at ease consuming a range of APIs exposed as Connectors. These Logic App connectors will perform the sequence of actions defined in the workflow whenever the trigger gets fired. Further more you can quickly develop highly scalable integration solutions for your enterprise and business-to-business (B2B) scenarios. 

## Triggers
[Triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/built-in) are the starting point for a Azure Logic App workflow that will fire when new data or event that meets the trigger condition occur. Connectors in Logic Apps itself provide various triggers. Custom triggers can also be created using custom connectors.

## Actions 

The [Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/built-in) performs the business operations when input is provided through the managed connectors. Each time the trigger fires, the Logic App engine creates an instance that runs the actions in the workflow. These actions can also include data conversions and flow controls, such as conditional statements, switch statements, loops, and branching.



## Azure Active Directory Graph API
The [Graph API](https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/azure-active-directory-what-is-the-graph-api#:~:text=The%20Graph%20API%20of%20Azure,groups%2C%20and%20other%20common%20entities.) of Azure AD provides a broad set of standard queries that can be used to retrieve metadata information about the tenantâ€™s directory and its data structure, but also about users, groups, and other common entities.


## About this exercise

Previously we have already registered an APP in Azure Active Directory.

## In this exercise

 * We will get client secret token, ClientId and TenantId of registered App from Azure active directory.
 * We will create a logic app.
 * We will create a trigger to initiate the logic app.
 * We will initialize required variables.
 * We will get the access token using the required variable.
 * We will fetch Users information using access token.


 Here are the steps to begin with 

 ## Step 1: Getting Required Information
 
To get the Client secret token go to registered App and select `Certificates & Secrets` then click on the Client secret tab and copy token from value column as below

To Get the ClientId & TenantId go to registered App then click overview and copy the ClientId & TenantId values as below

## Step 2: Create Azure Logic App

Create a new resource and select Logic App. Select the relevant Subscription and resource group, enter the logic app name and click `Review + Create` button as below

after creating logic app click on go to resource and then under templates create `Blank Logic App`.

## Step 3: Create Http Trigger

To initialize the logic app, Search the Http triggers and select HTTP (When a HTTP request is received) as below 

![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168644708-2f73b620-5b95-4940-9249-84676a6dd1d8.PNG)

Go to https://jsonschema.net/app/schemas/0 and create JSON schema for empty array, Copy the created json and paste it in HTTP trigger's Request Body JSON Schema as below 

![33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168646161-bca61d2f-e42e-4162-8088-925bb9d9c3c0.PNG)

## Step 4: Initialize Action Variables

Initialize the 3 variables which are client secret token, ClientId and TenantId. To create a initialize variable search variable and select initialize as below 

![44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168646889-21874524-fe74-458a-b858-f2d650a5e03b.PNG)

Enter the variable name e.g. `client_secret`. select type as string and provide the client secretId which is fetched from the azure active directory.

The three variable will look like as below :

## Step 5: Get Access Token from Graph API

Create an HTTP Post request to https://login.mircosoftonline.com/tennantId/oauth2/token and pass the variables values in headers and body tags as below 

![77](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168744910-9f1d73cb-c8ee-4abd-9310-10e4913f9548.PNG)

Go to postman and create a post request same as above request and copy the response and create schema through https://jsonschema.net/app/schemas/0 

## Step 6: Parse JSON and Fetch Access Token

Create an parse Json action, Select Body tag in content.
Paste the token response schema in parse json schema body as below 


![99](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168748034-98119230-e663-44d4-83e1-e059aca89ecf.PNG)

Create a new variable to get the access token from Json response as below 

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168748421-7bd87002-0971-4bdb-abd0-3afd163d85b2.PNG)


## Step 7: Fetch Users using Graph Api

Create an Http Get request with url https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users to get the users list. Pass the access_token in authorization header tag as below 

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168748794-47fbd5c4-4bfc-416d-899e-46654925de7e.PNG)


Create a response action to get the response body as below 

![133](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100709775/168749468-ff82f157-fb8d-40a6-8794-f34d08f5380a.PNG)


Call the trigger's HTTP post URL from the postman and see its working.
